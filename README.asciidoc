== Overview
The Xeno-Canto Labeling Platform aims to enhance the Xeno-Canto database by providing a public platform where users can collaboratively label recordings using a Wikipedia-like approach. These user-generated labels will be displayed in spectrograms for precise localization of animal sounds and made accessible via an API for researchers and developers.

== Features

* *Collaborative Labeling:* Users can contribute by labeling recordings, improving the accuracy and richness of the database.
* *Spectrogram Display:* Labels will be visually represented on spectrograms, allowing for precise identification and localization of sounds.
* *API Access:* Researchers and developers can access the labeled data via a public API, facilitating further research and application development.

== Key Question
How can we leverage collaborative efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of animal sound recordings for research and development purposes?

== Documentation
All documentation and UML diagrams related to this project can be found in the 'documentation' directory.

== Installation
To install the Xeno-Canto Labeling Platform, follow these steps:

. Make sure, Docker is installed on your machine
. Clone the repository
. change directory into root and then into `src`
. Install .NET Aspire, by running `dotnet workload update` and `dotnet workload install aspire`
. Install dependencies by running `dotnet restore`
. Run the application by changing into the `BirdAPI.AppHost` directory and running `dotnet run`
